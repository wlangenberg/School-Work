One of the aims of this task is to determine the portfolio based on the stocks included in the OMX index that can mimic its behavio]. [Project Description](Project1/Project1_Description.pdf) 

- [Project2:](Project2/Project2.pdf) - This project gave the experience to explore the use and performance of gradient boosting trees for binary classification. [Project Description](Project2/Project2_Description.pdf)

- [Project3:](Project3/Project3.pdf) - This project consist of one more theoretical task to see the connection between the SVM optimization problem in
terms of the slack variables, and the SVM optimization problem as a penalization method. The other task is intended to explore the use of SVM to perform binary classification with kernel trick. [Project Description](Project3/Project3_Description.pdf)

- [Project4:](Project4/Project4.pdf) - Larger group project where we are free to choose a dataset and form our own problem to solve. Aims to display the ability to carry out a project from raw data, suitable modeling and to correct interpretation of results. [Project Description](Project4/Project4_Description.pdf)
